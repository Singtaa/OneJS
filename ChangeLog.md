﻿# [2025-06-29] v2.2.4

- CultureInfo.InvariantCulture for Length parsing
- EditorScriptEngine updates

# [2025-06-04] v2.2.3

- Added tick Error handling event to ScriptEngine and EngineHost

# [2025-05-28] v2.2.2 - Misc Improvements

- Delayed EvalFile(). This ensures the inital <App /> mounting happens after the initial UIDocument load (so that the initial layouts are already calculated).
- Added an extra ".root" css specificity to generated TW classes. 

# [2025-05-21] v2.2.1 - Game UIs

Improved some workflows to support the rollout of our game UIs.

To upgrade from a previous version: 

- make sure to update `onejs-core` and `onejs-preact` to `^2.0.0`
- The following defaults have changed:
  - `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`
  - `input.css`, `.vscode/tasks.json`
- You can delete them and run scene with ScriptEngine again (be mindful if you have custom changes)

To install OneJS's Game UIs, you can now run:

    ```bash
    npx oj add all
    ```

This will work as long as you have a `premade-uis.tgz(.bytes)` file anywhere in your Assets/ folder. This file is only included in the OneJS Asset Store package.

# [2025-04-14] v2.1.15

`onejs/math` is now available! See `onejs-core` repo for more info.

- Backends MenuItems
- Removed BaseEditor override

- EngineHost Refactor

# [2024-12-08] v2.1.7 - Minor Tweak

- Added a global.d.ts by default

# [2024-12-02] v2.1.6 - Preparation for Editor UI

We’re releasing this now, ahead of the Editor UI update (expected in a couple of weeks), as it includes significant improvements and bug fixes that are worth rolling out early. 

If you are updating an existing project, make sure to also bump the `onejs-core` package to `^1.0.6` in your package.json.

- Added WebApi from V1
- `requestAnimationFrame()` bugfix (Thx @Kodra)
- `DomStyle.GetLength()` bugfix
- Use min/max for gradientrect
- Added support for global namespace in DTSGenerator
- `onejs-core` dependency bumped to `^1.0.6`
- Many more bugfixes and improvements in `onejs-core` and `onejs-preact`

(Most of the Editor UI code are actually in. However, we'll use the next release to get into the details.)
